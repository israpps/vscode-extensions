# ps2-irx-imports README

sintax highlight extension for PlayStation 2 Import lists for IRX modules (mipsr3000/IOP/PS1-CPU executables)

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

![prev]\(prev.png\)

> Tip: to complete the experience, I recommend changing the sintax highlight of `exports.tab` (if your project has one) to C

## Known Issues

module import start and end can't be folder (regex is not working?)


**Enjoy!**
